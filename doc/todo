This document contains a list of small code-level tasks that require no further
design. The intention is that people take tasks from the list to avoid being
blocked. Synchronization of concurrent list updates is through email. Task is
moved into IN-PROGRESS section after someone has started working on it.
Completed tasks are moved into DONE section. The list is populated by team and
sub-team leads, contact them to add more things here.

TODO

2012-May-04 .gdbinit macros for basic Colibri structures

    Add to core/.gdbinit file gdb macros to display core Colibri structures:
    lists, vectors, &c. Preferably, the macros should be placed in .gdbinit
    files, located in the corresponding modules, with top-level .gdbinit loading
    them.

2012-May-04 embed session fops into foms

    rpc/session code allocated fops and foms separately. Preferable approach is
    to embed the fop in its fom and to use c2_fop_init() to initialize it. (The
    reason sessions allocate fops separately is that c2_fop_init() wasn't
    there.)

2012-May-04 use heap consistency checking

    http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Heap-Consistency-Checking.html

    Modify build process to optionally use -lmcheck. 

    Investigate the possibility to use mprobe() from lib/bob.c (and some other
    places, like lib/list.c, lib/tlist.c). This can be difficult, because
    objects can be statically allocated.

2012-May-04 remove obsolete fop-related structures from sunrpc transport

    Due to a historical accident, sunrpc network transport uses higher layer
    (fop) data-structures internally. This should be cleaned up.

2012-May-04 embed c2_sm in c2_fom

    Use standard state machine with states RUNNING, READY and WAITING for
    c2_fom.

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in reqh_service.c

    Use lists based on C2_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in colibri_setup.c

    Use lists based on C2_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()
