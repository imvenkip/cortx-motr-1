This document contains a list of small code-level tasks that require no further
design. The intention is that people take tasks from the list to avoid being
blocked. Synchronization of concurrent list updates is through email. Task is
moved into IN-PROGRESS section after someone has started working on it.
Completed tasks are moved into DONE section. The list is populated by team and
sub-team leads, contact them to add more things here.

                          ***** TODO *****

2012-May-10 Embed c2_sm in c2_rpc_{session,conn,item}

2012-May-15 Add mnemonic tags to doc/todo items for ease of reference.

2012-Jul-26 Replace atomic c2_fom_domain::fd_foms_nr with
            c2_fom_domain_is_idle() function that iterates over all localities
            and checks that queues are empty.

2012-Jul-26 c2_time_t is now a scalar with architecture-independent semantics
            (nanoseconds since epoch). Replace calls to
            c2_time_{before,after,...}() with direct comparisons.

2012-Jul-26 Use gcc builtins __sync_fetch_and_add, ... for use-space
            c2_atomic64. Check first, that this is supported by our target
            compiler version.

2012-Jul-26 addb context should be embedded in reqh.

2012-Jul-26 Call c2_processors_init() in c2_init(). Get rid of explicit
            c2_processors_init() calls.

2012-Jul-26 Get rid of c2_fom::fo_fol, use fom->fo_loc->fl_dom->fd_reqh->rh_fol
            instead.

2012-Jul-26 Add lib/thread.h:c2_is_awkward(), implement in kernel and user
            space. Tag code. c2_is_awkward() should return true iff the context
            is unsafe for blocking and locking (interrupt handler, signal
            handler, timer call-back, chan call-back, &c.). In kernel this is
            in_irq(). In user space, this should be based on
            pthread_getspecific(). Timer and chan call-backs should be handled.

2012-Jul-26 Use type-safe lists in fom.[ch].

2012-Aug-01 -include "config.h"

    Add `-include "config.h"' compiler option (possibly to CFLAGS of
    configure.ac). Delete `#include "config.h"' directives from source
    files; remove the corresponding stanza from doc/source-structure.

                          ***** IN-PROGRESS *****

2012-May-09 [Dima] Replace all debugging printf-s and printk-s with C2_LOG()-s

                          ***** DONE *****

2012-May-04 [Amit] .gdbinit macros for basic Colibri structures

    Add to core/.gdbinit file gdb macros to display core Colibri structures:
    lists, vectors, &c. Preferably, the macros should be placed in .gdbinit
    files, located in the corresponding modules, with top-level .gdbinit loading
    them.

2012-May-04 [Andriy] Add all magic numbers to doc/magix

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in reqh_service.c

    Use lists based on C2_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in colibri_setup.c

    Use lists based on C2_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-22 Use tailored type safe lists in rpc

    Use lists based on C2_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-14 Use #pragma once in headers
