   @section net-test-network-fspec-ds Data Structures

   @section net-test-network-fspec-sub Subroutines
   <i>Mandatory for programmatic interfaces.  Components with programming
   interfaces should provide an enumeration and brief description of the
   externally visible programming interfaces.</i>

   @subsection net-test-network-fspec-sub-cons Constructors and Destructors

   @subsection net-test-network-fspec-sub-acc Accessors and Invariants

   @subsection net-test-network-fspec-sub-opi Operational Interfaces

   @section net-test-network-fspec-cli Command Usage
   <i>Mandatory for command line programs.  Components that provide programs
   would provide a specification of the command line invocation arguments.  In
   addition, the format of any any structured file consumed or produced by the
   interface must be described in this section.</i>

   @section net-test-network-fspec-usecases Recipes
   <i>This section could briefly explain what sequence of interface calls or
   what program invocation flags are required to solve specific usage
   scenarios.  It would be very nice if these examples can be linked
   back to the HLD for the component.</i>
