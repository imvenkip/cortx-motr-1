   @defgroup net Networking

   @brief The networking module provides an asynchronous, event-based message
   passing service, with support for asynchronous bulk data transfer (if used
   with an RDMA capable transport).

   Major data-types in C2 networking are:
   @li Network buffer (c2_net_buffer);
   @li Network buffer descriptor (c2_net_buf_desc);
   @li Network buffer event (c2_net_buffer_event);
   @li Network domain (c2_net_domain);
   @li Network end point (c2_net_end_point);
   @li Network transfer machine (c2_net_transfer_mc);
   @li Network transfer machine event (c2_net_tm_event);
   @li Network transport (c2_net_xprt);

   See <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/xyratex.com/document/d/1tm_IfkSsW6zfOxQlPMHeZ5gjF1Xd0FAUHeGOaNpUcHA/edit?hl=en#">RPC Bulk Transfer Task Plan</a>
   for details on the design and use of this API.  If you are writing a
   transport, then the document is the reference for the internal threading and
   serialization model.

   See <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/xyratex.com/document/d/1TZG__XViil3ATbWICojZydvKzFNbL7-JJdjBbXTLgP4/edit?hl=en_US">HLD of Colibri LNet Transport</a>
   for additional details on the design and use of this API.

   See @ref netDep for the older interfaces.

    a <i>much</i> larger influence on the actual order in which buffer
    operations complete; we're not implying FIFO semantics here!
    Consider:
    - The underlying transport manages message buffers.
    Since there is a great deal of concurrency and latency involved with
    network communication, and message sizes can vary,
    a completed (sent or received) message buffer is not necessarily the first
    that was added to its "queue" for that purpose.
    - The upper protocol layers of the <i>remote</i> end points are
    responsible for initiating bulk data transfer operations, which ultimately
    determines when passive buffers complete in <i>this</i> process.
    The remote upper protocol layers can, and probably will, reorder requests
    into an optimal order for themselves, which does not necessarily correspond
    to the order in which the passive bulk data buffers were added.

    The fact of the matter is that the transfer machine itself
    is really only interested in tracking buffer existence and uses
    lists and not queues internally.

   Data structure used to provide asynchronous notification of

   All events have the following fields set:
   - nte_type
   - nte_tm
   - nte_time
   - nte_status

   The nte_type field should be referenced to determine the type of
   event, and which other fields of this structure get set:

   - C2_NET_TEV_ERROR provides error notification, out of the context of
     any buffer operation completion, or a transfer machine state change.
     No additional fields are set.
   - C2_NET_TEV_STATE_CHANGE provides notification of a transfer machine
     state change.
     The nte_next_state field describes the destination state.
     Refer to the nte_status field to determine if the operation succeeded.
     The nte_ep field is set if the next state is C2_NET_TM_STARTED; the
     value is used to set the ntm_ep field of the transfer machine.
   - C2_NET_TEV_DIAGNOSTIC provides diagnostic information.
     The nte_payload field may point to transport specific data.
     The API does not require nor specify how a transport produces
     diagnostic information, but does require that diagnostic events
     not be produced unless explicitly requested.
