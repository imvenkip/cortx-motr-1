   @defgroup bulksunrpc Sunrpc Messaging and Bulk Transfer Emulation Transport
   @ingroup net

   This module provides a network transport with messaging and bulk
   transfer capabilites implemented over the legacy and now deprecated
   Sunrpc transport.  The bulk transfer support does not provide 0 copy
   semantics. 3-tuple addressing of (host, port, service-id) is used for
   end points, with the further constraint that all transfer machines within
   the same process must use the same host and port, regardless of how many
   bulksunrpc domains are created.

   The transport will fake support for synchronous network buffer delivery.

   be made available for reuse until much later.  It also has the added
