   @section cqueueDLD-ovw Overview

   The circular queue provides a data structure and interfaces to manage a
   lock-free queue for a single producer and consumer.  The producer and
   consumer can be in different address spaces with the queue in shared memory.
   The circular queue is designed to specifically meet the needs of the
   @ref KLNetCoreDLD "Core API". <!-- ./linux_kernel/klnet_core.c -->
   In particular see the @ref KLNetCoreDLD-lspec-bevq "The Buffer Event Queue"
   section.

   The queue implementation does not address how the consumer gets notified that
   queue elements have been produced. That functionality is provided separately
   by the Core API nlx_core_buf_event_wait() subroutine.

   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-comps Component Overview

   The circular queue is a single component.

   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-q Logic of the Circular Queue

   The circular queue is a FIFO queue.  The implementation maintains pointers
   for the consumer and producer, and operations for accessing these pointers
   and for moving them around the circular queue elements.  The application
   manages the memory containing the queue itself, and adds new elements to the
   queue when the size of the queue needs to grow.  In this discussion of the
   logic, the pointers are named @c consumer, @c producer and @c next for
   brevity.

   @dot
   digraph {
   {
       rank=same;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       nlx_core_bev_cqueue;
       node [shape=record];
       struct1 [label="<f0> consumer|<f1> producer"];
   }
   {
       rank=same;
       ordering=out;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       "element list";
       node [shape=record];
       list1 [label="<f0> |<f1> y|<f2> x|<f3> x|<f4> x|<f5> x|<f6> |<f7> "];
       "element list" -> list1 [style=invis];
   }
   {
       rank=same;
       x1 [shape=point width=0 height=0];
       x2 [shape=point width=0 height=0];
       x1 -> x2 [dir=none];
   }
   nlx_core_bev_cqueue -> "element list" [style=invis];
   struct1:f0 -> list1:f1;
   struct1:f1 -> list1:f6;
   list1:f7 -> x2 [dir=none];
   list1:f0 -> x1 [dir=back];
   }
   @enddot

   The elements starting after @c consumer up to but not including @c producer
   contain data to be consumed (those elements marked with "x" in the diagram).
   So, @c consumer follows @c producer around the circular queue.  When
   @c consumer->next is the same as @c producer, the queue is empty
   (requiring that the queue be initialized with at least 2 elements).  The
   element pointed to by @c consumer (element "y" in the diagram) is the
   element most recently consumed by the consumer.  The producer cannot use this
   element, because if it did, producing that element would result in moving
   @c producer so that it would pass @c consumer.

   In the context of the LNet Buffer Event Queue, the transport should add
   enough elements to the queue strictly before it enqueues buffer operations
   requiring subsequent completion notifications.  The number required is the
   total number of possible events generated by queued buffers, plus one extra
   element for the most recently consumed event notification.  The circular
   queue does not enforce this requirement, but does provide APIs that the
   transport can use to determine the current number of elements in the queue
   and to add new elements.

   The element denoted by @c producer is returned by bev_cqueue_pnext() as
   long as the queue is not full.  This allows the producer to determine the
   next available element and populate it with the data to be produced.  Once
   the element contains the data, the producer then calls bev_cqueue_put()
   to make that element available to the consumer.  This call also moves the
   @c producer pointer to the next element.

   The consumer uses bev_cqueue_get() to get the next available element
   containing data in FIFO order.  Consuming an element causes @c consumer to
   be pointed at the next element in the queue.  After this call returns, the
   consumer "owns" the element returned, element "y" in the diagram.  The
   consumer owns this element until it calls bev_cqueue_get() again, at which
   time ownership reverts to the queue and can be reused by the producer.

   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-xlink Cross Address Space Linkage Support

   The pointers themselves are more complex than the description above suggests.
   The @c consumer pointer refers to the element just consumed in the consumer's
   (the transport) address space.  The @c producer pointer refers to the element
   in the producer's (the kernel) address space.

   A queue link element (the @c next pointer in the preceeding discussion) is
   represented by the nlx_core_bev_link data structure:
   @code
   struct nlx_core_bev_link {
            // Self pointer in the transport address space.
            nlx_core_opaque_ptr_t cbl_c_self;
            // Self pointer in the kernel address space.
            nlx_core_opaque_ptr_t cbl_p_self;
            // Pointer to the next element in the consumer address space.
            nlx_core_opaque_ptr_t cbl_c_next;
            // Pointer to the next element in the producer address space.
            nlx_core_opaque_ptr_t cbl_p_next;
   };
   @endcode
   The data structure maintains separate "opaque" pointer fields for the
   producer and consumer address spaces.  Elements in the queue are linked
   through both flavors of their @c next field.  The initialization of this data
   structure will be described in @ref cqueueDLD-lspec-qalloc.  The opaque
   pointer type is derived from ::c2_atomic64.

   When the producer performs a bev_cqueue_put() call, internally, this call
   uses nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_p_next to refer to the next element.
   Similarly, when the consumer performs a bev_cqueue_get() call, internally,
   this call uses nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_c_next.  Note that only
   allocation, discussed below, modifies any of these pointers.  Steady-state
   operations on the queue only modify the @c consumer and @c producer pointers.

   The data structure also contains "self" pointers for each address
   space. These pointers permit comparison against the queue head's @c
   consumer and @c producer pointer values from the producer and consumer
   address spaces respectively. For example, the abstract check

   @code
       q->producer != q->consumer
   @endcode

   performed in producer space is actually implemented as

   @code
       pq->cbcq_producer->cbl_c_self != pq->cbcq_consumer
   @endcode

   Here, the @c pq pointer itself is the pointer to the shared
   nlx_core_bev_cqueue object in the producer address space.  This pointer is
   made known to the producer when the queue is created (e.g. when the transport
   allocates the queue, it passes the transport space pointer to the object to
   the producer which maps that memory into the producer address space).  Note
   that this check is safe in producer space because only the producer changes
   the value of the @c producer pointer and the @c pq pointer is never changed
   after the queue object is allocated.  The equivalent safe call in consumer
   space would be:

   @code
       cq->cbcq_consumer->cbl_p_self != cq->cbcq_producer
   @endcode

   In this case, the @c cq pointer refers to the same queue object in shared
   memory, but this pointer is in the consumer's address space.

   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-qalloc Circular Queue Allocation

   The circular queue must contain at least 2 elements, as discussed above.
   Additional elements can be added to maintain the requirement that the number
   of elements in the queue equals or exceeds the number of pending buffer
   operations, plus one element for the most recently consumed operation.

   The initial condition is shown below.  In this diagram, the queue is empty
   (see the state discussion, below).  There is room in the queue for one
   pending buffer event and one completed/consumed event.

   @dot
   digraph {
   {
       rank=same;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       nlx_core_bev_cqueue;
       node [shape=record];
       struct1 [label="<f0> consumer|<f1> producer"];
   }
   {
       rank=same;
       ordering=out;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       "element list";
       node1 [shape=box];
       node2 [shape=box];
       "element list" -> node1 [style=invis];
       node1 -> node2 [label=next];
       node2 -> node1 [label=next];
   }
   nlx_core_bev_cqueue -> "element list" [style=invis];
   struct1:f0 -> node1;
   struct1:f1 -> node2;
   }
   @enddot

   Before adding additional elements, the following are true:
   - The number of elements in the queue, N, equals the number of pending
   operations plus one for the most recently consumed operation completion
   event.
   - The producer produces one event per pending operation.
   - The producer will never catch up with the consumer.  Given the required
   number of elements, the producer will run out of work to do when it has
   generated one event for each buffer operation, resulting in a state where
   <tt> producer == consumer </tt>.

   This means the queue can @b safely be expanded at the location of the @c
   consumer pointer (i.e. in the consumer address space), without
   affecting the producer.  Elements are added as follows:

   -# Allocate and initialize a new queue element (referred to as @c newnode)
      which sets @c newnode->c_self and @c newnode->p_self.
   -# Set <tt>  newnode->next = consumer->next </tt>
   -# Set <tt> consumer->next = newnode        </tt>
   -# set <tt>       consumer = newnode        </tt>

   Steps 2-4 are performed in bev_cqueue_add().  Because several pointers need
   to be updated, simple atomic operations are insufficient.  Thus, the
   transport layer must synchronize calls to bev_cqueue_add() and
   bev_cqueue_get(), because both calls affect the consumer.  Given that
   bev_cqueue_add() completes its three operations before returning, and
   bev_cqueue_add() is called before the new buffer is added to the queue,
   there is no way the producer will try to generate an event and move its
   pointer forward until bev_cqueue_add() completes.  This allows the transport
   layer and core layer to continue interact only using atomic operations.

   A diagrammatic view of these steps is shown below.  The dotted arrows signify
   the pointers before the new node is added.  The Step numbers correspond to
   steps 2-4 above.
   @dot
   digraph {
   {
       rank=same;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       nlx_core_bev_cqueue;
       node [shape=record];
       struct1 [label="<f0> consumer|<f1> producer"];
   }
   newnode [shape=box];
   struct1:f0 -> newnode [label="(4)"];
   node1 -> newnode [label="next (3)"]
   newnode -> node2 [label="next (2)"]
   {
       rank=same;
       ordering=out;
       "element list" [shape=plaintext];
       node1 [shape=box];
       node2 [shape=box];
       node1 -> node2 [style=dotted];
       node2 -> node1 [label=next];
   }
   nlx_core_bev_cqueue -> "element list" [style=invis];
   struct1:f0 -> node1 [style=dotted];
   struct1:f1 -> node2;
   }
   @enddot

   Once again, updating the @c next pointer is less straight forward than the
   diagram suggests.  In step 1, the node is allocated by the transport layer.
   Once allocated, initialization includes the transport layer setting the
   nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_c_self pointer to point at the node and having
   the kernel core layer "bless" the node by setting the
   nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_p_self link.  After the self pointers are set,
   the next pointers can be set by using these self pointers.  Since allocation
   occurs in the transport address space, the allocation logic uses the
   nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_c_next pointers of the existing nodes for
   navigation, and sets both the @c cbl_c_next and
   nlx_core_bev_link::cbl_p_next pointers.  The @c cbl_p_next pointer
   is set by using the @c cbl_c_next->cbl_p_self value, which is treated
   opaquely by the transport layer.  So, steps 2 and 3 update both pairs of
   pointers.  Allocation has no affect on the @c producer pointer itself, only
   the @c consumer pointer.

   The resultant 3 element queue looks like this:
   @dot
   digraph {
   {
       rank=same;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       nlx_core_bev_cqueue;
       node [shape=record];
       struct1 [label="<f0> consumer|<f1> producer"];
   }
   {
       rank=same;
       ordering=out;
       node [shape=plaintext];
       "element list";
       node2 [shape=box];
       newnode [shape=box];
       node1 [shape=box];
       "element list" -> newnode [style=invis];
       newnode -> node2 [label=next];
       node2 -> node1 [label=next];
       node1 -> newnode [label=next];
   }
   nlx_core_bev_cqueue -> "element list" [style=invis];
   struct1:f0 -> newnode;
   struct1:f1 -> node2;
   }
   @enddot


   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-state State Specification

   The circular queue can be in one of 3 states:
   - empty: This is the initial state and the queue returns to this state
   whenever @code consumer->next == producer @endcode
   - full: The queue contains elements and has no room for more. In this state,
   the producer should not attempt to put any more elements into the queue.
   This state can be expressed as @code producer == consumer @endcode
   - partial: In this state, the queue contains elements to be consumed and
   still has room for additional element production. This can be expressed as
   @code consumer->next != producer && consumer != producer @endcode

   As discussed @ref cqueueDLD-lspec-xlink "above", implementing these
   comparisons requires the use of the appropriate opaque pointers in the
   nlx_core_bev_link data structure.  The implementation of tests for these
   states varies depending on if the producer or the consumer is making the
   test.  Note also that there is no direct way for the producer to detect the
   empty state, because the @c consumer pointer is meaningful only in the
   consumer (transport) space.

   @subsection cqueueDLD-lspec-thread Threading and Concurrency Model

   A single producer and consumer are supported.  Atomic variables,
   @c consumer and @c producer, represent the range of elements in the queue
   containing data.  Because these pointers are atomic, no locking is needed
   to access them by a single producer and consumer.  Furthermore, because these
   pointers are used only for simple set or get operations, not compound
   operations (e.g. increment or compare and set) a simple scalar data type can
   be used.  Multiple producers and/or consumers must synchronize externally.

   The transport layer acts both as the consumer and the allocator, and both
   operations use and modify the @c consumer variable and related pointers.  As
   such, calls to bev_cqueue_add() and bev_cqueue_get() must be synchronized.
   The transport layer holds the transfer machine c2_net_transfer_mc::ntm_mutex
   when it calls bev_cqueue_add().  The transport layer will also hold this
   mutex when it calls bev_cqueue_get().

   @section cqueueDLD-O Analysis

   The circular queue (the struct nlx_core_bev_cqueue) consumes fixed size
   memory, independent of the size of the elements contains the queue's data.
   The number of elements can grow over time, where the number of elements is
   proportional to the number of current and outstanding buffer operations.
   This number of elements will reach some maximum based on the peak activity in
   the application layer.  Operations on the queue are O(1) complexity.

   @section cqueueDLD-fspec-ds Data Structures

   The circular queue is defined by the nlx_core_bev_cqueue data
   structure.

   @section cqueueDLD-fspec-sub Subroutines

   Subroutines are provided to:
   - initialize and finalize the nlx_core_bev_cqueue
   - produce and consume elements in the queue

   @see @ref bevcqueue "Detailed Functional Specification"

   @section cqueueDLD-fspec-usecases Recipes

   The nlx_core_bev_cqueue provides atomic access to the producer and
   consumer elements in the circular queue.

   In addition, semaphores or other synchronization mechanisms can be used to
   notify the producer or consumer when the queue changes, eg. when it becomes
   not empty.

   @subsection cq-init Initialization

   The circular queue is initialized as follows:

   @code
   struct nlx_core_buffer_event *e1;
   struct nlx_core_buffer_event *e2;
   struct nlx_core_bev_cqueue myqueue;

   C2_ALLOC_PTR(e1);
   C2_ALLOC_PTR(e2);
   bev_cqueue_init(&myqueue, &e1->cbe_tm_link, &e2->cbe_tm_link);
   @endcode

   @subsection cq-allocator Allocator

   The event queue can be expanded to make room for additional buffer events.
   This should be performed before buffers are queued.  One element should exist
   on the event queue for each expected buffer operation, plus one additional
   element for the "current" buffer operation.

   @code
   size_t needed;
   struct nlx_core_buffer_event *el;

   ... ; // acquire the lock shared with the consumer
   while (needed > bev_cqueue_size(&myqueue)) {
       C2_ALLOC_PTR(el);
       ... ; // initialize the new element for both address spaces
       bev_cqueue_add(&myqueue, el);
   }
   ... ; // release the lock shared with the consumer
   @endcode

   @subsection cq-producer Producer

   The (single) producer works in a loop, putting event notifications in the
   queue:

   @code
   bool done;
   struct nlx_core_bev_link *ql;
   struct nlx_core_buffer_event *el;

   while (!done) {
       ql = bev_cqueue_pnext(&myqueue);
       el = container_of(ql, struct nlx_core_buffer_event, cbe_tm_link);
       ... ; // initialize the element
       bev_cqueue_put(&myqueue);
       ... ; // notify blocked consumer that data is available
   }
   @endcode

   @subsection cq-consumer Consumer

   The (single) consumer works in a loop, consuming data from the queue:

   @code
   bool done;
   struct nlx_core_bev_link *ql;
   struct nlx_core_buffer_event *el;

   while (!done) {
       ... ; // acquire the lock shared with the allocator
       ql = bev_cqueue_get(&myqueue);
       if (ql == NULL) {
           ... ; // unlock a lock shared with the allocator
           ... ; // block until data is available
           continue;
       }

       el = container_of(ql, struct nlx_core_buffer_event, cbe_tm_link);
       ... ; // operate on the current element
       ... ; // release the lock shared with the allocator
