   @section LNetCoreDLD-fspec-ovw API Overview
   The LNet Transport Core presents an address space agnostic API to the LNet
   Transport layer.  These interfaces are declared in the file
   @ref net/lnet/lnet_core.h.

   The interface is implemented differently in the kernel and in user space.
   The kernel interface interacts directly with LNet; the user space interface
   uses a device driver to communicate with its kernel counterpart and
   uses shared memory to avoid event data copy.

   The Core API offers no callback mechanism.  Instead, the transport must
   poll for events.  Typically this is done on one or more dedicated threads,
   which exhibit the desired processor affiliation required by the higher
   software layers.

   The following sequence diagram illustrates the typical operational flow:
   @msc
   A [label="Application"],
   N [label="Network"],
   x [label="XO Method"],
   t [label="XO Event\nThread"],

   @section LNetCoreDLD-fspec-ds API Data Structures
   The API requires that the transport application maintain API defined shared
   data for various network related objects:
   - nlx_core_domain
   - nlx_core_transfer_mc
   - nlx_core_buffer

   The sharing takes place between the transport layer and the core layer.
   This will span the kernel and user address space boundary when using the
   user space transport.

   These shared data structures should be embedded in the transport
   application's own private data.  This requirement results in an
   initialization call pattern that takes a pointer to the standard network
   layer data structure concerned and a pointer to the API's data structure.

   Subsequent calls to the API only pass the API data structure pointer.  The
   API data structure must be eventually finalized.

   @section LNetCoreDLD-fspec-subs Subroutines
   The API subroutines are categorized as follows:

   - Initialization, finalization, cancellation and query subroutines:
     - nlx_core_buf_deregister()
     - nlx_core_buf_register()
     - nlx_core_dom_fini()
     - nlx_core_dom_init()
     - nlx_core_get_max_buffer_segment_size()
     - nlx_core_get_max_buffer_size()
     - nlx_core_tm_start()
     - nlx_core_tm_stop()
     .
     These interfaces have names roughly similar to the associated
     c2_net_xprt_ops method from which they are intended to be directly or
     indirectly invoked.  Note that there are no equivalents for the @c
     xo_tm_init(), @c xo_tm_fini() and @c xo_tm_confine() calls.

   - End point address parsing subroutines:
     - nlx_core_ep_addr_decode()
     - nlx_core_ep_addr_encode()

   - Buffer operation related subroutines:
     - nlx_core_buf_active_recv()
     - nlx_core_buf_active_send()
     - nlx_core_buf_del()
     - nlx_core_buf_msg_recv()
     - nlx_core_buf_msg_send()
     - nlx_core_buf_passive_recv()
     - nlx_core_buf_passive_send()
     - nlx_core_buf_desc_encode()
     - nlx_core_buf_desc_decode()
     .
     The buffer operation initiation calls are all invoked in the context of
     the c2_net_buffer_add() subroutine.  All operations are immediately
     initiated in the Lustre LNet kernel module, though results will be
     returned asynchronously through buffer events.

   - Event processing calls:
     - nlx_core_buf_event_wait()
     - nlx_core_buf_event_get()
     .
     The API assumes that only a single transport thread will be used to
     process events.

   Invocation of the buffer operation initiation subroutines and the
   nlx_core_buf_event_get() subroutine should be serialized.
