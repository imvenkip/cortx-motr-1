   @defgroup sm State machine

   This modules defines interfaces to functionality common to typical
   non-blocking state machines extensively used by Mero.

   The main difference between "state machine" (non-blocking) code and
   "threaded" (blocking) code is that the latter blocks waiting for some events
   while having some computational state stored in the "native" C language stack
   (in the form of automatic variables allocated across the call-chain). Because
   of this the thread must remain dedicated to the same threaded activity not
   only during actual "computation", when processor is actively used, but also
   for the duration of wait. In many circumstances this is too expensive,
   because threads are heavy objects.

   Non-blocking code, on the other hand, packs all its state into a special
   data-structures before some potential blocking points and unpacks it after
   the event of interest occurs. This allows the same thread to be re-used for
   multiple non-blocking computations.

   Which blocking points deserve packing-unpacking depends on
   circumstances. Long-term waits for network or storage communication are prime
   candidates for non-blocking handling. Memory accesses, which can incur
   blocking page faults in a user space process are probably too ubiquitous for
   this. Memory allocations and data-structure locks fall into an intermediate
   group.

   This module defines data-structures and interfaces to handle common
   non-blocking state-machine functionality:

       - state tracking and state transitions;

       - concurrency;

       - interaction between a state machine and external world (both
         non-blocking and threaded);

       - accounting and statistics collection.

   <b>State and transitions.</b>

   State machine state is recorded in m0_sm::sm_state. This is supposed to be a
   relatively coarse-grained high level state, broadly determining state machine
   behaviour. An instance of m0_sm will typically be embedded into a larger
   structure containing fields fully determining state machine behaviour. Each
   state comes with a description. All descriptions for a particular state
   machine are packed into a m0_sm_conf::scf_state[] array.

   State machine is transferred from one state to another by a call to
   m0_sm_state_set() (or its variant m0_sm_fail()) or via "chained" transitions,
   see below.

   <b>Concurrency.</b>

   State machine is a part of a state machine group (m0_sm_group). All state
   machines in a group use group's mutex to serialise their state
   transitions. One possible scenario is to have a group for all state machines
   associated with a given locality (m0_fom_locality). Alternatively a
   group-per-machine can be used.

   <b>Interaction.</b>

   The only "output" event that a state machine communicates to the external
   world is (from this module's point of view) its state transition. State
   transitions are announced on a per-machine channel (m0_sm::sm_chan). This
   mechanism works both for threaded and non-blocking event consumers. The
   formers use m0_sm_timedwait() to wait until the state machine reaches
   desirable state, the latter register a clink with m0_sm::sm_chan.

   "Input" events cause state transitions. Typical examples of such events are:
   completion of a network or storage communication, timeout or a state
   transition in a different state machine. Such events often happen in
   "awkward" context: signal and interrupt handlers, timer call-backs and
   similar. Acquiring the group's mutex, necessary for state transition in such
   places is undesirable for multiple reasons:

       - to avoid self-deadlock in a case where an interrupt or signal is
         serviced by a thread that already holds the mutex, the latter must be
         made "async-safe", which is quite expensive;

       - implementation of a module that provides a call-back must take into
         account the possibility of the call-back blocking waiting for a
         mutex. This is also quite expensive;

       - locking order dependencies arise between otherwise unrelated
         components;

       - all these issues are exasperated in a situation where state transition
         must take additional locks, which it often does.

   The solution to these problems comes from operating system kernels design,
   see the AST section below.

   There are 2 ways to implement state machine input event processing:

       - "external" state transition, where input event processing is done
         outside of state machine, and m0_sm_state_set() is called to record
         state change:

@code
struct foo {
	struct m0_sm f_sm;
	...
};

void event_X(struct foo *f)
{
	m0_sm_group_lock(f->f_sm.sm_grp);
	process_X(f);
	m0_sm_state_set(&f->f_sm, NEXT_STATE);
	m0_sm_group_unlock(f->f_sm.sm_grp);
}
@endcode

      - "chained" state transition, where event processing logic is encoded in
      m0_sm_state_descr::sd_in() methods and a call to m0_sm_state_set() causes
      actual event processing to happen:

@code
int X_in(struct m0_sm *mach)
{
        struct foo *f = container_of(mach, struct foo, f_sm);
	// group lock is held.
	process_X(f);
	return NEXT_STATE;
}

struct m0_sm_conf foo_sm_conf = {
	...
	.scf_state = foo_sm_states
};

struct m0_sm_state_descr foo_sm_states[] = {
	...
	[STATE_X] = {
		...
		.sd_in = X_in
	},
	...
};

void event_X(struct foo *f)
{
	m0_sm_group_lock(f->f_sm.sm_grp);
	// this calls X_in() and goes through the chain of state transitions.
	m0_sm_state_set(&f->f_sm, STATE_X);
	m0_sm_group_unlock(f->f_sm.sm_grp);
}

@endcode

   <b>Accounting and statistics.</b>

   This module accumulates statistics about state transitions and time spent in
   particular states. For additional flexibility these data are reported through
   an addb context supplied during state machine initialisation so that the same
   context can be used for other purposes too.

   @todo accounting and statistics is not currently implemented.

   <b>AST.</b>

   Asynchronous System Trap (AST) is a mechanism that allows a code running in
   an "awkward context" (see above) to post a call-back to be executed at the
   "base level" under a group mutex. UNIX kernels traditionally used a similar
   mechanism, where an interrupt handler does little more than setting a flag
   and returning. This flag is checked when the kernel is just about to return
   to the user space. If the flag is set, the rest of interrupt processing
   happens. In Linux a similar mechanism is called a "top-half" and
   "bottom-half" of interrupt processing. In Windows it is a DPC
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Procedure_Call) mechanism, in older
   DEC kernels it was called a "fork queue".

   m0_sm_ast structure represents a call-back to be invoked under group
   mutex. An ast is "posted" to a state machine group by a call to
   m0_sm_ast_post(), which can be done in any context, in the sense that it
   doesn't take any locks. Posted asts are executed

       - just after group mutex is taken;

       - just before group mutex is released;

       - whenever m0_sm_asts_run() is called.

   Ast mechanism solves the problems with input events mentioned above at the
   expense of

       - an increased latency: the call-back is not executed immediately;

       - an additional burden of ast-related book-keeping: it is up to the ast
         user to free ast structure when it is safe to do so (i.e., after the
         ast completed execution).

   To deal with the latency problem, a user must arrange m0_sm_asts_run() to be
   called during long state transitions (typically within loops).

   There are a few ways to deal with the ast book-keeping problem:

       - majority of asts will be embedded in some longer living data-structures
         like foms and won't need separate allocation of freeing;

       - some ast users might allocate asts dynamically;

       - the users which have neither a long-living data-structure to embed ast
         in nor can call dynamic allocator, have to pre-allocate a pool of asts
         and to guarantee somehow that it is never exhausted.

   If an ast is posted a m0_sm_group::s_clink clink is signalled. A user
   managing a state machine group might arrange a special "ast" thread (or a
   group of threads) to wait on this channel and to call m0_sm_asts_run() when
   the channel is signalled:

   @code
   while (1) {
           m0_chan_wait(&G->s_clink);
           m0_sm_group_lock(G);
	   m0_sm_asts_run(G);
           m0_sm_group_unlock(G);
   }
   @endcode

   A special "ast" thread is not needed if there is an always running "worker"
   thread or pool of threads associated with the state machine group. In the
   latter case, the worker thread can wait on m0_sm_group::s_clink in addition
   to other channels it waits on (see m0_clink_attach()).

   m0_sm_group_init() initialises m0_sm_group::s_clink with a NULL call-back. If
   a user wants to re-initialise it with a different call-back or to attach it
   to a clink group, it should call m0_clink_fini() followed by m0_clink_init()
   or m0_link_attach() before any state machine is created in the group.
