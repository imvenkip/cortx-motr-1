   @brief DLD of configuration schema

   This file defines the interfaces and data structures to store and
   access the Mero configuration information in database. Mero
   configuration information is used to describe how a Mero file system
   is organized by storage, nodes, devices, containers, services, etc.

   These data structures are used for on-disk purpose.

   <hr>
   @section DLD-ovw Overview

   This DLD contains the data structures and routines to organize the
   configuration information of Mero, to access these information.
   These configuration information is stored in database, and is populated
   to clients and servers who are using these information to take the whole
   Mero system up. These information is cached on clients and servers.
   These information is treated as resources, which are protected by locks.
   So configuration may be invalidated and re-acquired (that is update)
   by users when resources are revoked.

   The configuration schema is to provide a way to store, load, and update
   these informations. How to maintain the relations in-between these data
   strucctures is done by its upper layer.
