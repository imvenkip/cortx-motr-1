 *   - C2_RPC_SERVER_CTX_DECLARE() used to create rpc server context;
 * - DB layer:
 *   - c2_db_pair_setup() and c2_table_lookup() used to access
 *     configuration values stored in db.
 * - FOP, FOM, REQH:
 *   - c2_fom_block_at();
 *   - c2_fom_block_leave();
 *   - c2_fom_block_enter();
 *   - c2_long_read_lock();
 *   - c2_long_write_lock().
 * - Colibri setup:
 *   - c2_cs_setup_env() configures Colibri to use confd's environment.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section confd-dld-highlights Design Highlights
 *
 * - User-space implementation.
 * - Provides a "FOP-based" interface for confc to access configuration
 *   information.
 * - Relies on request handler threading model and is driven by
 *   reqh. Request processing is based on FOM execution.
 * - Maintains its own configuration cache, implementation of which is
 *   common to confd and confc.
 * - Several confd state machines (FOMs) processing requests from
 *   configuration consumers can work with configuration cache
 *   concurrently.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section confd-dld-lspec Logical Specification
 *
 * Confd service initialization is performed by request handler. To
 * allocate Confd service and its internal structures in memory @ref
 * c2_confd_service_locate() is used.
 *
 * Confd service type is registered in `subsystem' data structure of
 * "colibri/init.c", the following lines are added:
 * @code
 * struct init_fini_call subsystem[] = {
 *      ...
 *	{ &c2_confd_global_init, &c2_confd_global_fini,
 *	  "confd_service" },
 *      ...
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Configuration cache pre-loading procedure traverses all tables of
 * configuration db. Since relations between neighbour levels only are
 * possible, tables of higher "levels of DAG" are processed first.
 * The following code example presents pre-loading in details:
 *
 * @code
 * conf_cache_preload (...)
 * {
 *    for each record in the "profiles" table do
 *      ... allocate and fill struct c2_conf_profile from p_prof
 *    endfor
 *
 *    for table in "file_systems", "services",
 *              "nodes", "nics", "storage_devices",
 *	        in the order specified, do
 *       for each record in the table, do
 *         ... allocate and fill struct c2_conf_obj ...
 *         ... create DAG struct c2_conf_relation to appropriate conf object ...
 *       endfor
 *    end for
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * FOP format, FOP operation vector, FOP type, and RPC item type have
 * to be defined for each FOP.  The following structures are defined
 * for c2_conf_fetch FOP:
 * - struct c2_fop_type_format c2_conf_fetch_tfmt --- defines format
 *   registered in *.ff used in confd;
 * - struct c2_fop_type c2_conf_fetch_fopt --- defines FOP type;
 * - struct c2_fop_type_ops c2_conf_fetch_ops --- defines FOP
 *   operation vector;
 * - struct c2_rpc_item_type c2_rpc_item_type_fetch --- defines RPC
 *   item type.
 *
 * FOPs used in configuration service are defined in @ref confd_fop_dfspec.
 *
 * c2_fom_fetch_state() - called by reqh to handle incoming
 * confc requests. Implementation of this function processes all
 * FOP-FOM specific and c2_conf_fetch_resp phases:
 * @code
 * static int c2_fom_fetch_state(struct c2_fom *fom)
 *  {
 *       checks if FOM should transition into a generic/standard
 *       phase or FOP specific phase.
 *
 *       if (fom->fo_phase < FOPH_NR) {
 *               result = c2_fom_state_generic(fom);
 *       } else {
 *		... process c2_conf_fetch_resp phase transitions ...
 *	 }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Request handler triggers user-defined functions to create FOMs for
 * processed FOPs. Service has to register FOM-initialization functions
 * for each FOP treated as a request:
 *   - c2_conf_fetch;
 *   - c2_conf_update;
 *
 * To do so, the appropriate structures and functions have to be
 * defined. For example the following used by c2_conf_fetch FOP:
 *
 * @code
 * static const struct c2_fom_type_ops fom_fetch_type_ops = {
 *       .fto_create = fetch_fom_create
 * };
 *
 * struct c2_fom_type c2_fom_fetch_mopt = {
 *       .ft_ops = &fom_fetch_type_ops
 * };
 *
 * static int fetch_fom_create(struct c2_fop *fop, struct c2_fom **m)
 * {
 *    1) allocate fom;
 *    2) c2_fom_init(fom, &c2_fom_ping_mopt, &fom_fetch_type_ops, fop, NULL);
 *    3) *m = fom;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The implementation of c2_fom_fetch_state() needs the following
 * functions to be defined:
 *
 * - fetch_check_request(), update_check_request() - check incoming
 *     request and validates requested path of configuration objects.
 *
 * - fetch_next_state(), update_next_state() - transit FOM phases
 *   depending on the current phase and on the state of configuration
 *   objects.
 *
 * - obj_serialize() - serializes given object to FOP.
 *
 * - fetch_failure_handle(), update_failure_handle() - handle occurred
 *   errors.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section confd-lspec-state State Specification
 *
 * Confd as a whole is not a state machine, phase processing is
 * implemented on basis of FOM of c2_conf_fetch, c2_conf_update FOPs.
 * After corresponding FOM went through a list of FOM specific phases
 * it transited into F_INITIAL phase.
 *
 * The number of state machine instances correspond to the number of
 * FOPs being processed in confd.
 *
 * c2_conf_fetch FOM state transition diagram:
 * @dot
 *  digraph conf_fetch_phase {
 *      node [fontsize=9];
 *      edge [fontsize=9];
 *      F_INITIAL [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *      F_SERIALISE;
 *      F_TERMINATE [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *      F_FAILURE [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *
 *      F_INITIAL -> F_SERIALISE [label=
 *      "c2_long_read_lock(c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock)"];
 *
 *      F_SERIALISE -> F_TERMINATE [label = "success"];
 *      F_SERIALISE -> F_FAILURE [label = "failure"];
 *  }
 * @enddot
 *
 * - F_INITIAL
 *   In this phase, incoming FOM/FOP-related structures are being
 *   initialized and FOP-processing preconditions are being
 *   checked. Then, an attempt is made to obtain a read lock
 *   c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock. When it's obtained then
 *   c2_long_lock logic transits FOM back into F_SERIALISE.
 *
 * - F_SERIALISE:
 *   Current design assumes that data is pre-loaded into configuration
 *   cache. In F_SERIALISE phase, c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock lock has
 *   been already obtained as a read lock.
 *   c2_conf_fetch_resp FOP is being prepared for sending by looking
 *   up requested path in configuration cache and unlocking
 *   c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock.  After that, c2_conf_fetch_resp FOP
 *   is sent with c2_rpc_reply_post().  fetch_next_state() transits FOM into
 *   F_TERMINATE. If incoming request consists of a path which is not
 *   in configuration cache, then the c2_conf_fetch FOM is
 *   transitioned to the F_FAILURE phase.
 *
 * - F_TERMINATE:
 *   In this phase, statistics values are being updated in
 *   c2_confd::c_stat. c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock has to be
 *   unlocked.
 *
 * - F_FAILURE:
 *   In this phase, statistics values are being updated in
 *   c2_confd::c_stat, ADDB records are being added.
 *   c2_conf_fetch_resp FOP with an empty configuration objects
 *   sequence and negative error code is sent with c2_rpc_reply_post().
 *   c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock has to be unlocked.
 *
 *  @note c2_conf_stat FOM has a similar state diagram as
 *  c2_conf_fetch FOM does and hence is not illustrated here.
 *
 *  c2_conf_update FOM state transition diagram:
 * @dot
 *  digraph conf_update_phase {
 *      node [fontsize=9];
 *      edge [fontsize=9];
 *      U_INITIAL [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *      U_UPDATE;
 *      U_TERMINATE [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *      U_FAILURE [style=filled, fillcolor=lightgrey];
 *
 *      U_INITIAL -> U_UPDATE [label=
 *      "c2_long_write_lock(c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock)"];
 *
 *      U_UPDATE -> U_TERMINATE [label = "success"];
 *      U_UPDATE -> U_FAILURE [label = "failure"];
 *  }
 * @enddot
 *
 * - U_INITIAL:
 *   In this phase, incoming FOM/FOP-related structures are being
 *   initialized and FOP-processing preconditions are being
 *   checked. Then, an attempt is made to obtain a write lock
 *   c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock. When it's obtained then
 *   c2_long_lock logic transits FOM back into U_UPDATE.
 *
 * - U_UPDATE:
 *   In current phase, c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock lock has been
 *   already obtained as a write lock. Then, configuration cache has
 *   to be updated and c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock lock should be
 *   unlocked.  After that, c2_conf_update_resp FOP is sent with
 *   c2_rpc_reply_post(). update_next_state() transits FOM into
 *   U_TERMINATE.  If incoming request consists of a path which is not
 *   in configuration cache than the c2_conf_fetch FOM is transitioned
 *   to the U_FAILURE phase
 *
 * - U_TERMINATE:
 *   In this phase, statistics values are being updated in
 *   c2_confd::c_stat. c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock has to be
 *   unlocked.
 *
 * - U_FAILURE:
 *   In this phase, statistics values are being updated in
 *   c2_confd::c_stat, ADDB records are being added.
 *   c2_conf_update_resp FOP with an empty configuration objects
 *   sequence and negative error code is sent with c2_rpc_reply_post().
 *   c2_confd::c_cache::ca_rwlock has to be unlocked.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section confd-lspec-long-lock Locking model
 *
 * Confd relies on a locking primitive integrated with FOM signaling
 * mechanism. The following interfaces are used:
 *
 * @code
 * bool c2_long_{read,write}_lock(struct c2_longlock *lock,
 *                                struct c2_fom *fom, int next_phase);
 * void c2_long_{read,write}_unlock(struct c2_longlock *lock);
 * bool c2_long_is_{read,write}_locked(struct c2_longlock *lock);
 * @endcode
 *
 * c2_long_{read,write}_lock() returns true iff the lock is
 * obtained. If the lock is not obtained (i.e. the return value is
 * false), the subroutine would have arranged to awaken the FOM at the
 * appropriate time to retry the acquisition of the lock.  It is
 * expected that the invoker will return C2_FSO_AGAIN from the state
 * function in this case.
 *
 * c2_long_is_{read,write}_locked() returns true iff the lock has been
 * obtained.
 *
 * The following code example shows how to perform a transition from
 * F_INITIAL to F_SERIALISE and obtain a lock:
 * @code
 * static int fom_fetch_state(struct c2_fom *fom)
 * {
 *      //...
 *      struct c2_long_lock_link *link;
 * 	if (fom->fo_phase == F_INITIAL) {
 * 		// Initialise things.
 *		// ...
 *		// Retreive long lock link from derived FOM object: link = ...;
 *		// and acquire the lock
 *		return C2_FOM_LONG_LOCK_RETURN(c2_long_read_lock(lock,
 *								 link,
 *								 F_SERIALISE));
 *	}
 *	//...
 * }
 * @endcode
 * @see fom-longlock <!-- @todo fom-longlock has to be defined in future -->
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
 * @section confd-lspec-thread Threading and Concurrency Model
 *
 * Confd creates no threads of its own but instead is driven by the
 * request handler. All threading and concurrency is being performed
 * on the Request Handler side, registered in the system.  Incoming
 * FOPs handling, phase transitions, outgoing FOPs serialization,
 * error handling is done in callbacks called by reqh-component.
 *
 * Configuration service relies on rehq component threading model and
 * should not acquire any locks or be in any waiting states, except
 * listed below. Request processing should be performed in an
 * asynchronous-like manner. Only synchronous calls to configuration
 * DB are allowed which should be bracketed with c2_fom_block_{enter,leave}().
 *
 * Multiple concurrently executing FOMs share the same configuration
 * cache and db environment of confd, so access to them is
 * synchronized with the specialized c2_longlock read/write lock
 * designed for use in FOMs: the FOM does not busy-wait, but gets
 * blocked until lock acquisition can be retried. Simplistic
 * synchronization of the database and in-memory cache through means
 * of this read/writer lock (c2_confd::c_cache::ca_lock) is
 * sufficient, as the workload of confd is predominantly read-only.
 *
 * @subsection confd-dld-lspec-numa NUMA Optimizations
 *
 * Multiple confd instances can run in the system, but no more than
 * one per request handler. Each confd has its own data-base back-end
 * and its own pre-loaded copy of data-base in memory.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section confd-dld-conformance Conformance
 *
 * - @b i.conf.confd.user
 *   Confd is implemented in user space.
 * - @b i.conf.cache.data-model
 *   Configuration information is organized as outlined in section 4.1
 *   of the HLD. The same data structures are used for confc and
 *   confd.  Configuration structures are kept in memory.
 * - @b i.conf.cache.unique-objects
 *   A registry of cached objects (c2_conf_cache::cc_registry) is used
 *   to achieve uniqueness of configuration object identities.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section confd-dld-ut Unit Tests
 *
 * @test obj_serialize() will be tested.
 * @test {fetch,update}_next_state() will be tested.
 *
 * @test Load predefined configuration object from configuration db.
 * Check its predefined value.
 *
 * @test Load predefined configuration directory from db. Check theirs
 * predefined values.
 *
 * @test Fetch non-existent configuration object from configuration db.
 *
 * <hr> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
 * @section confd-O Analysis
 *
 * Size of configuration cache, can be evaluated according to a number
 * of configuration objects in configuration db and is proportional to
 * the size of the database file
 *
 * Configuration request FOP (c2_conf_fetch) is executed in
 * approximately constant time (measured in disk I/O) because the
 * entire configuration db is cached in-memory and rarely would be
 * blocked by an update.
