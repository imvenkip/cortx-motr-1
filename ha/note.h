/**
 * @defgroup ha-note HA notification
 *
 * TODO update
 *
 * This module defines protocols and functions used to communicate HA-related
 * events between HA and Mero core.
 *
 * Any HA-related event is represented as a state change of a configuration
 * object. Configuration objects are stored in the Mero configuration data-base
 * hosted by confd services and accessible to Mero and HA instances through
 * confc module. A configuration object is identified by a unique 128-bit
 * identifier.
 *
 * HA-related state of a configuration object is represented by enum
 * m0_ha_obj_state. It is important to understand that this state is *not*
 * stored in confd. confd stores the "basic" information describing the
 * nomenclature of system elements (nodes, services, devices, pools, etc.) and
 * their relationships. HA maintains additional state on top of confd, which
 * describes the run-time behaviour of configuration elements.
 *
 * Among other things, confd stores, for certain types of objects, their
 * "delegation pointers". A delegation pointer of an object X is some object Y
 * that should be used when X fails. For example, to organise a fail-over pair,
 * 2 services should have delegation pointers set to each other. The delegation
 * pointer of a pool points to the pool to which writes should be re-directed in
 * case of an NBA event. When an object fails, the chain formed by delegation
 * pointers is followed until a usable object is found. If the chain is
 * exhausted before a usable object is found, a system error is declared. All
 * consecutive attempts to use the object would return the error until HA state
 * or confd state changes.
 *
 * <b>Use cases</b>
 *
 * 0. Mero initialisation
 *
 * On startup, Mero instance connects to confd and populates its local confc
 * with configuration objects. Then, Mero instance calls m0_ha_state_get() (one
 * or more times). This function accepts as an input parameter a vector
 * (m0_ha_nvec) that identifies objects for which state is queried
 * (m0_ha_note::no_state field is ignored). m0_ha_state_get() constructs a fop
 * of m0_ha_state_get_fopt type with nvec as data and sends it to the local HA
 * instance (via supplied session).
 *
 * HA replies with the same vector with m0_ha_note::no_state fields
 * set. m0_ha_state_get() stores received object states in confc and notifies
 * the caller about completion through the supplied channel.
 *
 * 1. Mero core notifies HA about failure.
 *
 * On detecting a failure, Mero core calls m0_ha_state_set(), which takes as an
 * input an nvec (with filled states), describing the failures, constructs
 * m0_ha_state_set_fopt fop and sends it to the local HA instance via supplied
 * session. HA replies with generic fop reply (m0_fop_generic_reply).
 *
 * @note that there is a separate mechanism, based on m0ctl, which is used to
 * notify HA about failures which cannot be reported through RPC.
 *
 * 2. HA notifies Mero about failure.
 *
 * When HA agrees about a failure, it sends to each Mero instance a
 * m0_ha_state_set_fopt fop. Mero replies with generic fop reply.
 *
 * m0_ha_state_accept() is called when a m0_ha_state_set_fopt fop is received.
