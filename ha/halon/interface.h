 *
 * @section halon-interface-highlights Design Highlights
 *
 * - only one m0_halon_interface in a single process address space is supported
 *   at the moment;
 * - user of m0_halon_interface shouldn't care about rpc, reqh or other stuff
 *   that is not documented here. Threading constraints should be taken into
 *   account though.
 *
 * @section halon-interface-lspec Logical Specification
 *
 * @subsection halon-interface-tag Message Handling
 *
 * There are 2 kinds of messages: received and sent.
 * Each message is received or sent in context of m0_ha_link.
 *
 * When a message arrives the msg_received_cb() is executed. The user should
 * call m0_halon_interface_delivered() for each received message. The call means
 * that the message shoulnd't be sent again if the current process restarts.
 *
 * To send a message user calls m0_halon_interface_send(). For each message sent
 * in this way either msg_is_delivered_cb() or msg_is_not_delivered_cb() is
 * called. Exactly one of this functions is called exactly once for each message
 * sent.
 *
 * msg_is_delivered_cb() means that the message has been successfully delivered
 * to the destination and it is not going to be resent if the destination
 * restarts. msg_is_not_delivered_cb() is called if the message can't be
 * delivered. It may be delivered already but there is no confirmation that it
 * has been delivered.
 *
 * @subsection halon-interface-tag Message Tag
 *
 * Each message has a tag. The tag has uint64_t type and it's assigned
 * internally when user tries to send a message (m0_halon_interface_send(),
 * for example).  Tag value is unique for all the messages sent or received
 * over a single m0_ha_link. No other assumption about tag value should be used.
 *
 * Tag is used for message identification when struct m0_ha_msg is not available.
 *
 * @subsection halon-interface-req-id Entrypoint Request ID
 *
 * Each entrypoint request has an ID. The ID is m0_uint128 and it's assigned
 * internally when a new entrypoint request is received.
 *
 * Request ID is used to make a mapping between entrypoint request and
 * m0_ha_link.
 *
 * @subsection halon-interface-lifetime Lifetime and Ownership
 *
 * - m0_halon_inteface shouldn't be used before m0_halon_interface_init() and
 *   shouldn't be used after m0_halon_interface_fini();
 * - m0_halon_interface_start()
 *   - local_rpc_endpoint is not used after the function returns;
 *   - callbacks can be executed at any point after the function is called but
 *     before m0_halon_interface_stop() returns;
 * - m0_halon_interface_entrypoint_reply()
 *   - all parameters (except hi) can be freed by the caller after the function
 *     returns;
 *   - can be called only after entrypoint_request_cb() is executed;
 *   - should be called exactly once for each entrypoint request;
 * - m0_halon_interface_send()
 *   - m0_ha_msg is not used after the function returns;
 * - entrypoint_request_cb()
 *   - remote_rpc_endpoint can be finalised at any moment after the callback
 *     returns;
 * - msg_received_cb()
 *   - msg is owned by the user only before m0_halon_interface_delivered() is
 *     called for the message;
 * - entrypoint request id
 *   - is used by the user in m0_halon_interface_entrypoint_reply() after
 *     entrypoint_request_cb() is executed;
 *   - is used by m0_halon_interface in either link_connected_cb() or
 *     link_reused_cb();
 *   - is not used after m0_halon_interface_entrypoint_reply() is called and
 *     link_connected_cb() or link_reused_cb() executed;
 * - m0_ha_link
 *   - m0_halon_interface controls m0_ha_link's lifetime;
 *   - m0_ha_link doesn't exist
 *     - before link_connected_cb() is called;
 *     - after link_disconnected_cb() is finished;
 *   - m0_halon_interface_send(), m0_halon_interface_delivered()
 *     - can be used only after link_connected_cb() is executed for the link;
 *     - can't be used after m0_halon_interface_disconnect() is called.

 * @section halon-interface-threads Threading and Concurrency Model
 *
 * - thread which calls m0_halon_interface_init() is considered as main thread
 *   for m0 instance inside m0_halon_interface;
 * - m0_halon_interface_start(), m0_halon_interface_stop(),
 *   m0_halon_interface_fini() should be called from the exactly the same thread
 *   m0_halon_interface_init() is called (main thread);
 * - if m0_halon_interface is in WORKING state then Mero locality threads are
 *   created;
 * - each callback from m0_halon_interface_start() is executed in the locality
 *   thread. The callback function:
 *   - can be called from any locality thread;
 *   - shouldn't wait for network or disk I/O;
 *   - shoudln't wait for another message to come or for a message to be
 *     delivered;
 *   - can call m0_halon_interface_entrypoint_reply(),
 *     m0_halon_interface_send(), m0_halon_interface_delivered(),
 *     m0_halon_interface_disconnect().
 * - entrypoint_request_cb() can be called from any locality thread at any time
 *   regardless of other entrypoint_request_cb() executing;
 * - msg_received_cb()
 *   - is called sequentially, one by one for the messages from the same link
 *     in the same order the sender has sent the messages;
 * - msg_is_delivered_cb(), msg_is_not_delivered_cb()
 *   - for the same m0_ha_link are called sequentially, in the order
 *     m0_halon_interface_send() was called for the messages;
 * - msg_received_cb(), msg_is_delivered_cb(), msg_is_not_delivered_cb()
 *   - may be called from different threads for the same m0_ha_link;
 *   - if there are links L1 and L2, then callbacks for the messages from the
 *     links are not synchronised in any way;
 * - link_connected_cb(), link_reused_cb(), link_is_disconnecting_cb(),
 *   link_disconnected_cb()
 *   - are called sequentially for the same link;
 *   - may be called from different threads for the same link;
 * - m0_halon_interface_init(), m0_halon_interface_fini(),
 *   m0_halon_interface_start(), m0_halon_interface_stop() are blocking calls.
 *   After the function returns m0_halon_interface is already moved to the
 *   appropriate state;
 * - m0_halon_interface_entrypoint_reply(), m0_halon_interface_send(),
 *   m0_halon_interface_delivered(), m0_halon_interface_disconnect() are
 *   non-blocking calls. They can be called from:
 *   - main thread;
 *   - locality thread;
 *   - any callback.
