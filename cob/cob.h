   @defgroup cob Component objects

   A Component Object is a metadata layer that sits over a storage object.
   It references a single storage object and contains metadata describing
   the object. The metadata is stored in database tables. A C2 Global
   Object (i.e. file) is made up of a collection of Component Objects
   (stripes).

   Component object metadata includes:
   - namespace information: parent object id, name, links
   - file attributes: owner/mode/group, size, m/a/ctime, acls
   - fol reference information:  log sequence number (lsn), version counter

   cob domain

   Component object metadata is stored in database tables.  The database
   in turn is stored in a metadata container.  A cob_domain is a grouping
   of cob's described by a namespace or object index.  The objects referenced
   by the tables will reside in other, filedata containers.

   A c2_cob_domain is an in-memory structure that identifies these tables.
   The list of domains will be created at metadata container ingest (when
   a container is first "started/read/initialized/opened".)

   A c2_cob_domain cannot span multiple containers.  Eventually, there should
   be methods for combining/splitting containers and therefore cob
   domains and databases.

   A domain might cache component objects to speed up object lookup.
   This caching is not visible to upper layers.

/**
   In-memory representation of a component object.

   A c2_cob is an in-memory structure, populated as needed from database
   table lookups.  The c2_cob may be cached and should be protected by a lock.

   The exposed methods to get a new cob are:
   - c2_cob_lookup   (lookup by filename)
   - c2_cob_locate   (lookup by stob_id)
   - c2_cob_create(stob_id, filename, attrs)
   The cobs returned by these methods are always populated.
   An "empty" cob is never exposed.

   Users use c2_cob_get/put to hold references; the cob may be destroyed on
   the last put, or it may be cached for faster future lookup.
   @todo at some point, we me replace the co_ref by taking a reference on the
   underlying co_stob.  At that point, we will need a callback at last put.
   We wait to see how cob users will use these references, whether they need
   callbacks in turn, etc.

   A c2_cob serves multiple purposes:

   - it acts as a handle for the underlying metadata storage. Meta-data
   operations can be executed on persistent storage by calling functions on
   c2_cob;

   - it caches certain metadata attributes in memory.

   <b>Concurrency control</b>
   co_guard is used to protect agaist manipulation of data inside a
   c2_cob (currently usused as there are no manipulation methods yet).

   <b>Liveness</b>
   A c2-cob may be freed when the reference count drops to 0

   @note: The c2_nskey is allocated separately because it is variable length.
   Once allocated, the cob can free the memory by using CA_NSKEY_FREE.
