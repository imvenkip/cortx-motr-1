 * This component contains the File Operation Packets (FOP) definitions

 * - readv

 *
 * It describes the FOP formats along with brief description of the flow.
 *
 * Note: As authorization is carried on server, all request FOPs
 * contain uid and gid. For authentication, nid is included in every FOP.
 * This is to serve very primitive authentication for now.
