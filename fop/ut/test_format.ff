 * <b>fop format description and compilation</b>
 *
 * This is an example of a fop format definition file.
 *
 * A fop format definition is, technically, a fragment of a valid C language
 * source code. A fop format compiler (fop2c) adds certain macro and function
 * definitions to a fop format description to produce a compilable program. This
 * program, when run with certain arguments, outputs other C (or potentially not
 * C) source code, containing
 *
 *     @li definitions of C data types matching fop format description;
 *
 *     @li the same for Linux kernel xdr functions.

/**
   @def DEF(typename, aggr, field0, field1, ...)

   Introduces a "fop type" which is either a description of fop format or a type
   used by other fop types.

   @param typename - a name of the type. Must be a valid C language identifier.

   @param aggr - an aggregation structure of this type, see below.

   @param field0 - a field description, introduced by _() or _case() macro.

   Aggregation structure can be one of the following:

   @li RECORD. This defines a "record" fop type, similar to a C struct
   data-types and "structures" of ONC XDR (see
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506#section-4.14). Each instance of this type
   has a collection of fields specified in this call to DEF().

   @li UNION. This defines a "discriminated union" fop type, similar to a
   "discriminated union" of ONC XDR (see
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506#section-4.15).

   @li SEQUENCE. This defines a variable sized sequence of elements, similar to
   ONC XDR "variable-length array" (see
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506#section-4.13). Note that elements of a
   sequence can have different sizes.

   @li TYPEDEF. This defines another name for an already existing type.

   DEF() macro allows one to build complex fop types, starting from pre-defined
   "primitive types". A primitive type is one of VOID, BYTE, U32 or U64.

   <b>Constraints</b>

   There are some limitations on possible combination of fields and aggregation
   types:

   @li fields in a given type definition must all have different names.

   @li Fields introduced with _case() are called "tagged". Fields introduced
   with _() are called "untagged". Tagged fields are only permitted in UNION
   type definitions.

   @li Specifically, a UNION type definition must have at least 2 fields. First
   one must be untagged and the rest must be tagged. All tagged fields in a
   given UNION type definition must have different tags. Untagged field (called
   a "discriminant", always first) must have U32 type. An instance of a UNION
   fop type contains a discriminant and a value of UNION type field whose tag is
   equal to the discriminant value.

   @li TYPEDEF and SEQUENCE type definitions must have exactly one field.

   @li fields of primitive BYTE type can appear only in SEQUENCE type
   definitions.

   @see _case()
   @see VOID

/**
   @def _(name, type)

   Introduces a field in a fop type definition.

   @param name - a field name that must be unique within a given type
   definition.

   @param type - a field type. This must be either a primitive type of an
   already defined fop type.
 */

/**
   @def _case(tag, name, type)

   Introduces a tagged field within a discriminated union type definition.

   @param tag - a numerical constant value.

   @param name - a field name.

   @param type - a field type.
