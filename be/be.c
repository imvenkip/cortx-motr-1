 * - for persistent objects: open()/close()/create()/destroy()
 * - for preallocated in-memory objects:
 *   init()/fini()/allocate()/deallocate()/reset()
 * - module_setup() for objects initialised using m0_module
 *
 * @todo Interface tester
 *
 *
 * @section Captured regions lifecycle: capturing, seg and log I/O
 *
 * - Each segment change (by user) is followed by m0_be_tx_capture() (called by
 *   user);
 * - m0_be_tx_capture() does the following:
 *   - determines generation index of the region;
 *   - captures given region into transactions's reg_area. It is done by copying
 *     region data into tx reg_area;
 * - transaction is closed and grouped;
 * - tx group has it's own reg_area;
 * - group reg_area is a merge of all group tx-es reg_areas. Merge is done using
 *   m0_be_reg_area_merger. Merge rules:
 *   - if a region is in some tx reg_area from the group then the region is in
 *     group reg_area;
 *   - group reg_area contains regions with largest generation index among all
 *     transactions from the group;
 * - BE engine has reg_area called global reg_area. It contains merge of all
 *   group reg_areas. Global reg_area properties:
 *   - it has all regions of all group reg_areas with the latest generation
 *     index;
 *   - it is updated after group reg_area is filled by m0_be_reg_area_merger;
 *   - it is pruned after update. All regions with generation index less than
 *     lowest generation index of first captured region among all non-finalized
 *     transaction are removed from the global reg_area;
 * - group reg_area is logged as is;
 * - group reg_area is changed before placing taking into account the global
 *   reg_area. Regions from group reg_area that exist in global reg_area and
 *   have generation index less than corresponding region from the global
 *   reg_area are not placed - the new region data was or going to be placed
 *   (because the region is in the global reg_area).
 *
 *
 * @section m0_be_op design highligts
 *
 * - explicit transition from INIT to ACTIVE state and from ACTIVE to DONE
 *   state gives:
 *   - clear documentation where requested operation starts (if you see just
 *     m0_be_op_done() than operation was started somewhere else);
 *   - possibility to gather statistics about operations execution time.
