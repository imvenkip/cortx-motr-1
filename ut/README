The intent of this library is to include all code, which could be potentially
useful for several UTs and thus can be shared, avoiding duplication of
similar code.

*** NOTE ***  This library is linked as colibri module and not as colibri -ut
              library. This allows to use it in both - UTs and in standalone
              programs which don't use CUnit (and in kernel space as well).
              That's why it's important to avoid usage of CUnit constructs like
              C2_UT_ASSERT in this lib.
