The intent of this library is to include all code, which could be potentially
useful for several UTs and thus can be shared, avoiding duplication of
similar code.

*** NOTE ***  This library is linked as mero module and not as mero -ut
              library. This allows to use it in both - UTs and in standalone
	      programs (and in kernel space as well).
