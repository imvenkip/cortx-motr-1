/**
   @defgroup extmap Extent map abstraction

   Extent map is a persistent transactional collection of extents in an abstract
   numerical name-space with a numerical value associated to each extent.

   The name-space is a set of all 64-bit unsigned numbers from 0 to
   C2_BINDEX_MAX. An extent of the name-space consisting of numbers from A
   (inclusive) to B (exclusive) is denoted [A, B).

   A segment is an extent together with a 64-bit value associated with it,
   denoted as ([A, B), V).

   An extent map is a collection of segments whose extents are non-empty and
   form a partition of the name-space. 

   That is, an extent map is something like

   @f[
           ([0, e_0), v_0), ([e_0, e_1), v_1), \ldots, 
	   ([e_n, C2\_BINDEX\_MAX + 1), v_n)
   @f]

   Note that extents cover the whole name-space from 0 to C2_BINDEX_MAX without
   holes.

   Possible applications of extent map include:

   @li allocation data for a data object. In this case an extent in the
   name-space is interpreted as an extent in the logical offset space of data
   object. A value associated with the extent is a starting block of a physical
   extent allocated to the logical extent. In addition to allocated extents, a
   map might contain "holes" and "not-allocated" extents, tagged with special
   otherwise impossible values;

   @li various resource identifier distribution maps: file identifiers,
   container identifiers, layout identifiers, recording state of resource
   name-spaces: allocated to a certain node, free, etc.

   Extent map interface is based on a notion of map cursor (c2_emap_cursor): an
   object recording a position within a map (i.e., a segment reached by the
   iteration).

   A cursor can be positioned at the segment including a given point in the
   name-space (c2_emap_lookup()) and moved through the segments (c2_emap_next()
   and c2_emap_prev()).

   An extent map can be modified by the following functions:

   @li c2_emap_split(): split a segment into a collection of segments with given
   lengths and values, provided that their total length is the same as the
   length of the original segment;

   @li c2_emap_merge(): merge part of a segment into the next segment. The
   current segment is shrunk (or deleted if it would become empty) and the next
   segment is expanded downward;

   @li c2_emap_paste() handles more complicated cases.

   It's easy to see that these operations preserve extent map invariant that
   extents are non-empty and form the name-space partition.

   @note The asymmetry between split and merge interfaces (i.e., the fact that a
   segment can be split into multiple segments at once, but only two segments
   can be merged) is because a user usually wants to inspect a segment before
   merging it with another one. For example, data object truncate goes through
   the allocation data segments downward until the target offset of
   reached. Each segment is analyzed, data-blocks are freed is necessary and the
   segment is merged with the next one.

   @note Currently the length and ordering of prefix and value is fixed by the
   implementation. Should the need arise, prefixes and values of arbitrary size
   and ordering could be easily implemented at the expense of dynamic memory
   allocation during cursor initialization. Prefix comparison function could be
   supplied as c2_emap constructor parameter.
