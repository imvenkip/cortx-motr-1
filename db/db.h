/**
   @defgroup db Data-base interfaces.

   This file defines interfaces for access to a simple indexing mechanism,
   similar to data-base tables with primary index. Currently this interface is
   implemented on top of Oracle db5 (nee Sleepycat's Berkeley DB) and details of
   this implementation leak into data-structures. In the future, additional
   implementations will be added, specifically a simple memory-only
   implementation for Linux kernel, and the separation between generic and
   implementation-specific state will be exacted.

   Main data-types introduced here are:

   @li data-base environment (c2_dbenv), where tables are located in and to
   which transactions are confined;

   @li data-base table (c2_table): a container for records indexed by key;

   @li transaction (c2_db_tx): a group of operations over tables that is atomic
   and isolated (in the standard data-base sense of these words);

   Auxiliary data-types are:

   @li table cursor (c2_db_cursor) used to iterate over table records, and

   @li transaction waiter (c2_db_tx_waiter) used to get notifications of (or to
   wait until) transaction state changes.
