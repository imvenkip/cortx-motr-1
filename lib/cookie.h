/**
 * @defgroup cookie Cookie
 *
 * In a network-file-system, when a client queries for an in-memory object to
 * a server, server searches through a set of data-structures to retrieve the
 * object. Multiple queries asking for the same object lead to a repeated
 * search.
 *
 * Cookie mechanism avoids such redundant search operations. When the first
 * query for an object arrives, server searches the object, embeds it's address
 * in a cookie, and then sends this cookie to a client. Client then uses this
 * cookie in subsequent queries for the same object.
 *
 * As client is unaware of memory-updates at server-end, its necessary for
 * server to verify that received cookie is not a stale one. Server achieves
 * this by maintaining a global counter called generation-count. It embeds
 * a same value of generation-count in an object and a cookie associated with
 * it. On reception of a cookie, before returning a required object,
 * server ensures that value of generation-count in the cookie matches
 * with the one in the object.
