/**
   @defgroup timer Generic timer manipulation

   Any timer should call c2_timer_init() function before any function. That
   init function does all initialization for this timer. After that, the
   c2_timer_start() function is called to start the timer. The timer callback
   function will be called repeatedly, if this is a repeatable timer. Function
   c2_timer_stop() is used to stop the timer, and c2_timer_fini() to destroy
   the timer after usage.

   User supplied callback function should be small, run and complete quickly.

   There are two types of timer: soft timer and hard timer. For Linux kernel
   implementation, all timers are hard timer. For userspace implemenation,
   soft timer and hard timer have different mechanism:

   - Hard timer has better resolution and is driven by signal. The
     user-defined callback should take short time, should never block
     at any time. Also in user space it should be async-signal-safe
     (see signal(7)), in kernel space it can only take _irq spin-locks.
   - Soft timer creates separate thread to execute the user-defined
     callback for each timer. So the overhead is bigger than hard timer.
     The user-defined callback execution may take longer time and it will
     not impact other timers.

   @note c2_timer_* functions should not be used in the timer callbacks.
