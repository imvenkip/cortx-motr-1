/**
   @defgroup thread Thread

   Thread creation and manipulation interface (rather spartan at the moment).

   Threads can be created that will start execution by running a specified
   function invoked with a specified argument. Thread functions return void, a
   user must arrange a method of transferring results back from the thread if
   necessary.

   The only operation on a started thread is waiting for its completion
   ("joining" the thread).

/**
   Control block for a thread.

   <b>States</b>

   A thread control block can be in one of the following states:

   @li PARKED: thread is not yet started or has been joined already. In this
   state c2_thread::t_func is NULL;

   @li RUNNING: the thread started execution of c2_thread::t_func function, but
   hasn't yet been joined. Note that the thread can be in this state after
   return from c2_thread::t_func.

   <b>Concurrency control</b>

   A user is responsible for serialising access to a control block. For example,
   there should be no concurrent calls to c2_thread_init() or c2_thread_join()
   for the same c2_thread.

   <b>Liveness</b>

   Implementation only accesses control block as part of explicit calls to
   c2_thread interface functions. A user is free to destroy the control block at
   any moment, except for the possible resource leak in the case of running (and
   not yet joined) thread.

   static struct c2_thread tcb;

   result = C2_THREAD_INIT(&tcb, struct foo, NULL, worker, arg, "worker");

   Helper macro creating an anonymous function with a given body.

   For example:

   @code
   int x;

			   "add_%d", 1);

   LAMBDA is useful to create an "ad-hoc" function that can be passed as a
   call-back function pointer.

   @note resulting anonymous function can be called only while the block where
   LAMBDA macro was called is active. For example, in the code fragment above,
   the tcb thread must finish before the block where C2_THREAD_INIT() was called
   is left.

   @note Be careful if using LAMBDA in kernel code, as the code could be
   generated on the stack and would fault in the kernel as it is execution
   protected in the kernel.  If someone figures out the secret allocation
   sauce, update this note with the recipe; one observed problem was when a
   reference was made to an automatic variable from a lambda function, and that
   problem went away when the variable was made global.  Other lambda functions
   that simply returned values caused no problems in the kernel.
