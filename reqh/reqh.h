/**
   @defgroup reqh Request handler

   Request handler provides non-blocking infrastructure for fop execution.
   There typically is a single request handler instance per address space, once
   the request handler is initialised and ready to serve requests, it accepts
   a fop (file operation packet), iterpretes it by interacting with other sub
   systems and executes the desired file system operation.

   For every incoming fop, request handler creates a corresponding fom
   (file operation state machine), fop is executed in this fom context.
   For every fom, request handler performs some standard operations such as
   authentication, locating resources for its execution, authorisation of file
   operation by the user, &tc. Once all the standard phases are completed, the
   fop specific operation is executed.

/**
   Standard fom state transition function.

   This function handles standard fom phases from enum c2_fom_phase.

   First do "standard actions":

   - authenticity checks: reqh verifies that protected state in the fop is
     authentic. Various bits of information in C2 are protected by cryptographic
     signatures made by a node that issued this information: object identifiers
     (including container identifiers and fids), capabilities, locks, layout
     identifiers, other resources identifiers, etc. reqh verifies authenticity
     of such information by fetching corresponding node keys, re-computing the
     signature locally and checking it with one in the fop;

   - resource limits: reqh estimates local resources (memory, cpu cycles,
     storage and network bandwidths) necessary for operation execution. The
     execution of operation is delayed if it would overload the server or
     exhaust resource quotas associated with operation source (client, group of
     clients, user, group of users, job, etc.);

   - resource usage and conflict resolution: reqh determines what distributed
     resources will be consumed by the operation execution and call resource
     management infrastructure to request the resources and deal with resource
     usage conflicts (by calling DLM if necessary);

   - object existence: reqh extracts identities of file system objects affected
     by the fop and requests appropriate stores to load object representations
     together with their basic attributes;

   - authorization control: reqh extracts the identity of a user (or users) on
     whose behalf the operation is executed. reqh then uses enterprise user data
     base to map user identities into internal form. Resulting internal user
     identifiers are matched against protection and authorization information
     stored in the file system objects (loaded on the previous step);

   - distributed transactions: for operations mutating file system state, reqh
     sets up local transaction context where the rest of the operation is
     executed.

   Once the standard actions are performed successfully, request handler
   delegates the rest of operation execution to the fom type specific state
   transition function.

   Fom execution proceeds as follows:

   If a generic phase handler function fails while executing a fom, then it
   just sets the c2_fom::fo_rc to the result of the operation and returns FSO_WAIT.
   c2_fom_state_generic() then sets the c2_fom::fo_phase to FOPH_FAILED, logs an
   ADDB event, and returns, later the fom eecution proceeds as mentioned in above
   diagram.
   If fom fails while executing fop specific operation, the c2_fom::fo_phase is set
   to FOPH_FAILED already by the fop specific operation handler, and the c2_fom::fo_rc
   set to the result of the operation.
