/**
   @defgroup bufvec_xcode Generic Buffer Vector Encode/Decode routines.

   Encode/Decode functions for encoding/decoding various atomic types into
   buffer vectors. The functionality is very similar to the XDR functions.
   These routines can be used to implement a type encode/decode routine for
   each FOP, ADDB records etc.

   XXX:
   - We don't care about endianness currently. However, for this to work
   across different platforms and architectures, correct endianness conversion
   needs to be implemented. This will be taken up in the future.
   - Currently, we assume that the bufvecs supplied to the transcode routines
   have 8 byte aligned buffers with sizes multiple of 8 bytes.
