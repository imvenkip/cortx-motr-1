   @defgroup fol File operations log

   File operations log (fol) is a per-node collection of records, describing
   updates to file system state carried out on the node. See HLD (url below) for
   the description of requirements, usage patterns and constraints on fol, as
   well as important terminology (update, operation, etc.).

   A fol is represented by an instance of struct c2_fol. A fol record has two
   data-types associated with it:

   @li c2_fol_rec_desc: a description of a new fol record to be added to a
   fol. This description is used to add a record via call to c2_fol_add();

   @li c2_fol_rec: a record fetched from a fol. c2_fol_rec remembers its
   location it the fol.

   A fol record belongs to a fol type (c2_fol_rec_type) that defines how record
   reacts to the relevant fol state changes.

   There are two liveness and concurrency scopes for a c2_fol_rec, fetched from
   a fol:

   @li long-term: fol code guarantees that a record remains in the fol while its
   reference counter is greater than 0. A record's reference counter is
   manipulated by calls to c2_fol_get() and c2_fol_put(). Initial counter value
   is taken from c2_fol_rec_desc::rd_refcount at the moment of c2_fol_add()
   call. (Note that this means that by the time c2_fol_add() call for a record
   with initially zero reference counter returns, the record might be already
   culled.) Between record addition to the log and its culling the only record
   fields that could change are its reference counter and sibling updates state.

   @li short-term: data copied from the fol and pointed to from the record
   (object references, sibling updates and operation type specific data) are
   valid until c2_fol_rec_fini() is called. Multiple threads can access the
   record with a given lsn. It's up to them to synchronize access to mutable
