/**
   @defgroup rpc_onwire RPC wire format types and interfaces

   A C2 RPC is a container for items, FOPs and ADDB records.  The wire
   format of an RPC consists of a header and a sequence of encoded
   RPC items.

   The header consists of, in order
    - version, a uint32_t, currently only C2_RPC_VERSION_1 is supported
    - the number of RPC items in the RPC

   Each item is encoded as
    - opcode value which denotes a unique operation code for an rpc item type &
    is encoded as a uint32_t
    - length number of bytes in the item payload, encoded as a uint32_t
    - Various fields related to internal processing of an rpc item.
    - item payload ( the serialized data for each item )

    Each RPC item is directly serialized/deserialized into a network buffer.
    using the various bufvec encode/decode functions for atomic types.
    (see xcode/bufvec_xcode.h).

    XXX : Currently we assume (and check) that the the c2_bufvec-s, supplied to
    transcode functions have 8-byte aligned buffers with sizes multiple of
    8 bytes.

    XXX : Current implementation of onwire formats is only for RPC items
	  which are containers for FOPs.
