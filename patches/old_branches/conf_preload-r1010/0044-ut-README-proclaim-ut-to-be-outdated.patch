+Please ignore the contents of conf/ut/ directory (make exception for
+this README, though).
+
+The conf/* files are quite unstable at the moment, and symbols are
+frequently renamed.  Maintaining of conf/ut/* files is hard and rather
+pointless in such circumstances.
+
+I will update conf/ut/* when conf/* are more stable.
