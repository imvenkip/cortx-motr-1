 /**
  * @page conf-fspec-obj Configuration Objects
  *
- * XXX
+ * There are different kinds of configuration data: configuration of
+ * filesystems, services, nodes, storage devices, etc.  Configuration
+ * data is contained in configuration objects of which there are 7
+ * types:
+ * - c2_conf_profile,
+ * - c2_conf_filesystem,
+ * - c2_conf_service,
+ * - c2_conf_node,
+ * - c2_conf_nic,
+ * - c2_conf_sdev, and
+ * - c2_conf_partition.
+ *
+ * Different types of configuration objects have non-overlapping sets
+ * of fields (e.g., type of service is an attribute of c2_conf_service
+ * object), but some fields are common to all types of objects (e.g.,
+ * unique identifier - key - of an object or its status).  Such common
+ * fields are put together in c2_conf_obj structure, which is embedded
+ * into every configuration object as a field (e.g.,
+ * c2_conf_filesystem::cf_obj).
+ *
+ * c2_conf_obj is referred to as @em generic configuration object,
+ * while c2_conf_profile, ..., c2_conf_partition are @em concrete
+ * configuration objects.
  *
  * @see @ref conf_dfspec_obj "Detailed Functional Specification"
