- * XXX @todo Explain what is this registry (AKA objid-to-address mapping) for.
+ * Object id-to-address mapping, also known as a registry of cached
+ * configuration objects, is an in-memory database that associates
+ * object identities ({key, value} pairs) with memory addresses of
+ * these objects.  A confc or confd module maintaining configuration
+ * cache creates such a registry and uses it to ensure uniqueness of
+ * configuration objects stored in the cache.
  *
- * The implementation of c2_conf_map is based on in-memory Berkeley
- * DB, which is created and manipulated via Colibri database
- * interfaces ("db/db.h").
+ * A registry is represented by c2_conf_map structure. The
+ * implementation is based on in-memory Berkeley database, which is
+ * created and manipulated via Colibri database interfaces
+ * ("db/db.h").
