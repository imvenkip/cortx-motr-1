/**
 * A few notes on current version of layout and composite layout implementation.
 *
 * Notations: an object with default de-clustered parity layout is simply called
 * object, while an object with composite/capture layout is called
 * composite/capture object.
 *
 * (1) An object has an assocaited layout (m0_clovis_object::ob_layout). we
 *     didn't associate layout with entity as not all entity needs layout
 *     information and dix index keeps and maintains the layout details itself.
 *
 * (2) Currently, mero/clovis stores layout id and pool version as object
 *     attributes in IO or MD services. Layout API is NOT changing this for
 *     'normal' objects. Composite or capture objects store extra layout
 *     information in global layout index and layout specific indices (such
 *     as composite extent indices.). This method is chosen because:
 *       - If storing all layouts in global layout index, it implicitly create
 *         a tight binding between dix and applications, but not all
 *         applications need dix.
 *       - Changes to current object creation/deletion is minor.
 *       - If an object stores de-clustered parity layout in global layout index
 *         as well, creating/deleting an object includes one more round of rpc
 *         process to cas services.
 *     Note: the chosen method above is a temporary solution and is subject to
 *     change in the future when all object layouts are stored in dix.
 *
 * (3) m0_clovis_obj_op() for IO is not changed to include layout information as
 *     an application like HSM may change an object's layout from default
 *     de-clustered parity layout to composite layout and this change is
 *     hidden from other applications. Other applications issue IO ops like
 *     before. So clovis needs a way to tell the layout type of an object and
 *     retrieve details accrodingly.
 *
 *     Clovis makes use of layout id attribute and stores the layout type in
 *     the highest 16 bits of layout id.
 *
 * (4) m0_clovis_entity_{create|delete}() APIs are not changed. An object with
 *     default de-clustered parity layout is first created, if the apaplication
 *     wants to set the object to different layout such as composite layout,
 *     it does so by issuing a M0_CLOVIS_EO_LAYOUT_SET op.
 *
 * (5) 2 new ops M0_CLOVIS_EO_LAYOUT_{GET|SET} together with
 *     m0_clovis_layout_op() API are provided to allocated and initilised
 *     layout op. A few helper APIs are also provided to allocate/free layout.
 *
 * (6) Composite extents are stored in internally created indices and
 *     m0_clovis_composite_layer_idx() is provided to return the index.
 *     Applications can query it using normal index ops. Clovis also
 *     provide with some helper APIs to transform layer index's key/value
 *     to internal representations.
 *
 * (7) Current implementation has a few synchronous calls(points):
 *       - Layout is not retrieved from global layout index util an IO op
 *         is initilised for composite or capture object. Retrieving
 *         layout inside m0_clovis_obj_op() is a synchronous request.
 *       - Paticularly for composite layout, Clovis retrieves extents as well,
 *         which is also a set of synchronous NEXT queries.
 *       - When constructing IO op for a composite layer (sub object), pool
 *         version and layout id of sub object need to be known to build
 *         layout instance. These object attributes again are retrieved
 *         synchronously from services.
 *
 *    A solution to remove these synchronous calls is to implement
 *    a execution plan which forms a DAG representing the execution orders
 *    of steps. This requires re-write/organise many places in clovis and
 *    will leave for the next version.
