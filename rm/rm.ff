/** @file rm.ff
 *
 * This file defines RM-fops needed for RM-generic layer. All the layers using
 * RM will have to define their own FOPs to fetch resource data. RM-generic FOPs
 * provide a facility for resource rights management and to fetch small resource
 * data.
 *
 * <b>RM fop formats</b>
 *
 * Various RM data-structures have to be located based on information stored in
 * fops:
 *
 *     - resource type: identified by 64-bit identifier
 *       (c2_rm_resource_type::rt_id),
 *
 *     - resource: resource information is never passed separately, but only to
 *       identify a resource owner,
 *
 *     - owner: when a first request to a remote resource owner is made, the
 *       owner is identified by the resource
 *       (c2_rm_resource_type_ops::rto_encode()) it is a responsibility of the
 *       remote RM to locate the owner. In the subsequent fops for the same
 *       owner, it is identified by a 128-bit cookie (c2_rm_cookie),
 *
 *     - right: identified by an opaque byte array
 *       (c2_rm_resource_ops::rop_right_decode(),
 *       c2_rm_right_ops::rro_encode()). A 0-sized array in REVOKE and CANCEL
 *       fops is interpreted to mean "whole right previously granted",
 *
 *     - loan: identified by a 128-bit cookie (c2_rm_cookie).
